      <p>
          Sometimes a band just speaks to your soul. For me, this is Manchester Orchestra. 
          This Atlanta-formed band is led in vocals/songwriting/and guitar by Andy Hull. Formed in 2004, the rhythmic lulls of their music have graced alternative platforms worldwide. 
          Despite the young ages when first formed, the band hit hard with raw emotion, and evolved their sound throughout the years.

            There's so much I could say about them. Their music requires no excuse to play.
            But for the best things, check out their site!
